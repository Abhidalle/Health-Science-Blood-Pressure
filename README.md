# 💊 Hypertension Medication Efficacy Analysis

A Python-based clinical trial simulator that evaluates the effectiveness of hypertension medication across a diverse patient population. This project demonstrates high-speed array processing, data slicing, and statistical modeling using NumPy.

## 📊 Clinical Insights (The Story)
* **Treatment Delta Calculation:** Engineered a logic to measure "BP Drop" per individual, allowing for precise measurement of group improvement.
* **Risk Assessment:** Identified "Failed Cases" where the medication did not produce a positive result, calculating a total Trial Success Rate.
* **Demographic Segmentation:** Developed filters to isolate senior demographics (>60 years) and "Super Responders" (patients with >30mmHg improvement).
* **Reproducible Research:** Implemented `np.random.seed` to ensure that simulated clinical findings remain consistent across different testing environments.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Engineering
* **Core Engine:** Python 3.x
* **Primary Library:** NumPy (Advanced array manipulation and column stacking).
* **Data Slicing:** Utilizes advanced indexing to separate IDs, ages, and baseline metrics from a unified dataset.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Executive Summary Report:** Generates a formatted clinical report including demographics, treatment standard deviation, and efficacy metrics.
* **Automatic Scaling:** Designed to handle synthetic datasets of 100+ individuals using vectorized operations for maximum performance.
* **Variance Tracking:** Calculates Standard Deviation to measure the consistency of the drug's performance across the group.
